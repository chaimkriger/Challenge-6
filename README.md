## Housing Rental Analysis Application

To get the information needed for my Housing Rental Analysis Application, i first read the sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv file from the Resources folder into the notebook and create the DataFrame that I'll use in the analysis. 
I then calculate and plot the housing units per year, calculate and plot the average prices per square foot, compare the average prices by neighborhood, build an interactive neighborhood map, and compose my data story.


To calculate the number of housing units per year, i use numerical and visual aggregation to view the results as a bar chart. This allows me to determine the overall trend in housing units over the period that I'm analyzing.

To calculate the average price per square foot, i use numerical and visual aggregation to view the results as a line chart. This allows me determine if any of the years I am analyzing experienced a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year, and if the gross rent increased or decreased during that year.

I then use interactive visualizations and widgets to allow me to compare the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood. This helps me determine if the average sale price per square foot for 2016 more or less than the price thatâ€™s listed for 2012 for the Anza Vista neighborhood. 

To finish off the housing Rental Analysis Application, i build an interactive neighborhood map to answer analyze which neighborhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot.

All this infirmation with help with my analysis, and it is with this analyis that i build my data story.
